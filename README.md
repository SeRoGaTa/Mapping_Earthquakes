# Mapping_Earthquakes

####This repository will collect GEOJSON data from diferent websites and shows how earthquakes had happen in the world, here also you will be able to choose from 3 different types of maps and we have a 3 main layers that complete the analisis.

1. All earthquakes in the world with Tooltips that shown the place and magnitude
2. All the tectonic plates localization
3. The major earthquakes that had happen with also a tooltip on them.

###You could take the layers out if you need.

###The final work you'll find it in the folder of [Earthquake_Challenge](https://github.com/SeRoGaTa/Mapping_Earthquakes/tree/main/Earthquake_Challenge)
